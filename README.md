## How it Works

The Caeser Cipher encryption technique works by shifting each letter in the message by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, then 'a' becomes 'd', 'b' becomes 'e', and so on.

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter the message you want to encrypt/decrypt and the shift value, and click the appropriate button. The encrypted/decrypted message will be displayed on the screen.
